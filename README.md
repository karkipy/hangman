## Hangman
  A simple hangman in bash

## Motivation

One of my friend had let me know about someone who had made 2048 in bash, so was thinking of making a game in bash since then plus I got bored.

## Installation

Manual

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/karkipy/hangman
```

Inside the project


```bash
 cd hangman
```

Give the permission to the script

```bash
  chmod +x hangman
```

Move the script to /usr/local/bin for global access

```bash
 mv hangman  /usr/local/bin
```

### or

This does all the things above

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karkipy/hangman/master/hangman -o /usr/local/bin/hangman && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hangman
```



Restart the terminal and hit the command

```bash
  hangman
```
